# Weather_app
I made inactive the default styling, instead of a class.
I changed localStorage to use the API instead of direct assignment.
I moved the event handlers into the script to separate them from the structure.
I made temperatures when changing units.
I got rid of the &nbsp;s and replaced it with some styling.
